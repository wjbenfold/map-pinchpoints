# map-pinchpoints
Library for finding pinchpoints for hikers from OSM data

## User story

**As a** cyclist with a 3 hour handicap, **I want** to identify pinchpoints for hikers travelling from a start location to an end location on specified areas of map **so that** I can catch them and get points, whilst losing them points.

## Usage

```
    python alpha.py
